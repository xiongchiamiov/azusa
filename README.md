RSS feed reader. When I read an item in a feed, azusa compares that to the last
time the feed went from no new items to some new items (in number of times the
program's been opened) to determine a rough estimate of how bored I had to be to
read it. As it learns tastes more and more, I can start just reading the home
screen of the program, which has things I'm more likely to be interested in at
the top.

Like Google Reader, azusa can assign a feed to multiple folders. Unlike Google
Reader, azusa can nest folders arbitrarily deep (so that, for instance, anything
put in the "Python" folder is automatically included in "Programming").
Selecting a folder will show all feeds in that tag, ordered once again by
"interesting" value.

I haven't looked around at any of the popular feed readers other than Google
Reader, so there's a distinct possibility of this getting scrapped.

Likely developed in Python and QT (PySide rather than PyQT), although possibly a
web app.

Name unrelated: [Nakano Azusa] is a character from K-On!.
